# ALEX - AnaLysis for EXcogito

This library was developed for the postprocessing and for the analysis of data obtained from the EXCOGITO software (https://github.com/potestiolab/excogito), a program investigating the mapping problem in coarse-grained modelling of biomolecules.

For more information about the software and for some use cases have a look at:
* **A Multiscale Analysis of the CzrA Transcription Repressor Highlights the Allosteric Changes Induced by Metal Ion Binding**, M Rigoli, R Potestio, R Menichetti, The Journal of Physical Chemistry B 2025, 129(2), 611-625
* **EXCOGITO, an EXtensible COarse-GraIning TOol**, M Giulini, R Fiorentini, L Tubiana, R Potestio, Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling 2024, 64(12), 4912-4927
* **A journey through mapping space: characterising the statistical and metric properties of reduced representations of macromolecules**, R Menichetti, M Giulini, R Potestio, The European Physical Journal B 2021, 94(10), 1-26
* **An Information-Theory-Based Approach for Optimal Model Reduction of Biomolecules**, M Giulini, R Menichetti, MS Shell, R Potestio, Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation 2020, 16(11), 6795-6813

This library has been put together by Alessia Guadagnin Pattaro, a PhD student at the Statistical and Biological Physics group at University of Trento. The previously cited papers do not use this library for their own data analysis.

**The library is still under development, I am not a professional coder so the project may lack some technicalities**

## Installation

There are no particular requirements for this library.
1. Download the repository on your local machine;
2. Install the repository with `pip install /path/to/alex` or with `pip install -e .` to install the package globally.

It is possible to install the library in conda environments as well.
